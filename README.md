<h1>Iron Skies 2</h1>
Iron skies 2 is sequel to the SHMUP(shoot em up) I made back in the day with a friend. We had so many ideas for the first one
but we're unable to commit enough time due to schoolwork and our day jobs.

As you can see with the graphic the game itself is called Iron Skies(without the 2) but in reality it is the 2nd iteration of the series. Even if the first one was left in the state it was. This game is different than the first though, which is why its refered to as the sequel.

I decided to pick up our old project again in the form of a sequel. As I have now moved on to web programming I decided to create
the sequel in Javascript.
